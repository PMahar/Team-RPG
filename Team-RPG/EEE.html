		<p class="prompt" style="font-size: 25px">You get extremely red in the face shrinking in your seat thinking about how foolish you were. Your friend throws anther ball at you while you were cringing and it flys past you and hits the bus driver. This upsets the bus driver and she pulls the bus over. When the bus is pulled over the teachers scold your friend who threw the ball. After the scolding is over the bus driver goes to start the bus but it wonâ€™t start. The bus driver tries one more time and the buses motor starts smoking. The teachers tell you to go back to your seat and wait but you really want to step up and help.</p>

But you quickly realize that's the least of your problems when you notice that the noise was the bus trying to start. The noise happens three times and the bus starts smoking from under the hood. You ask the person next to you in the seat what happened and apparently, some goofballs were throwing stuff and accidentally hit the bus driver which caused the bus to get pulled over. The teachers are in the front of the bus discussing what to do.</mark></p>

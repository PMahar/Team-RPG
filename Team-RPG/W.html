As you walk past the front desk you hear Mrs. Hemmid asking Mrs. Jensis if she has seen you anywhere. Mrs. Jensis says she saw you walk by and go up the stairs to her left. At this moment you realize that Mr. N sent Mrs. Hemmid to check on you and she found out you were skipping your punishment. If you get caught now, you risk greater punishment.</mark></p>

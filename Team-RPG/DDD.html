		<p class="prompt" style="font-size: 25px">You get up, walk down the bus aisle and apologize to the bus driver. As you go to turn around to walk back to your seat your friend throws another paper ball at you. The ball misses hitting the bus driver. This upsets the bus driver and she pulls the bus over. When the bus is pulled over the teachers scold your friend who threw the ball. After the scolding is over the bus driver goes to start the bus but it wonâ€™t start. The bus driver tries one more time and the buses motor starts smoking. The teachers tell you to go back to your seat and wait but you really want to step up and help.</p>
